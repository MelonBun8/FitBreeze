#Demo

A simple application I made as my end-of-semester (1st) project in FAST.

NOTES:
The mp3 player, and its related functions were not coded by me, coded separately by a colleague, then integrated into the main/rest of the app by me. The idea for the name of the app and the player itself was mine, however.
Also, the songs were NOT chosen by me, they were chosen by my project teammates.
