#Demo

A simple application I made as my end-of-semester (1st) project in FAST.

NOTES:
The mp3 player, and its related functions were not coded by me, coded separately by a colleague, then integrated into the main/rest of the app by me. The idea for the name of the app and the player itself was mine, however.
Also, THE SONG CHOICES AREN'T MINE.
